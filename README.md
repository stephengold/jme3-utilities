# Jme3-utilities Project

The Jme3-utilities Project contains Java packages and assets, developed for
sgold's jMonkeyEngine projects, which might prove useful in similar projects.

It contains 4 sub-projects:

1. nifty: the `jme3-utilities-nifty` library for using NiftyGUI user
   interfaces with jMonkeyEngine
2. x: the `jme3-utilities-x` library of experimental software
3. moon-ccbysa: assets for a realistic Moon in `SkyControl`
4. tests: demos, examples, and test software

The `SkyControl` library, formerly a sub-project, is now a separate project
at [GitHub][skycontrol].

The textures sub-project is now part of
[the SkyControl Project][skycontrol].

The `jme3-utilities-heart` library, formerly a sub-project, is now a separate project
at [GitHub][heart].

The `jme3-utilities-ui` library, formerly a sub-project, is now a separate project
at [GitHub][acorus].

The `jme3-utilities-debug` library, formerly a sub-project, is now part of
[the Heart Library][heart].

The `Minie` library, formerly a sub-project, is now a separate project
at [GitHub][minie].

The `Wes` library, formerly a sub-project, is now a separate project
at [GitHub][wes].

## How to build Jme3-utilities from source

1. Install a [Java Development Kit (JDK)][openJDK],
   if you don't already have one.
2. Point the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to your JDK installation:
  + using Bash: `export JAVA_HOME="` *path to installation* `"`
  + using Windows Command Prompt: `set JAVA_HOME="` *path to installation* `"`
  + using PowerShell: `$env:JAVA_HOME = '` *path to installation* `'`
3. Download and extract the Jme3-utilities source code from GitHub:
  + `git clone https://github.com/stephengold/jme3-utilities.git`
  + `cd jme3-utilities`
  + `git checkout -b latest nifty-0.9.25`
4. Run the [Gradle] wrapper:
  + using Bash or PowerShell: `./gradlew build`
  + using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew build`

After a successful build,
Maven artifacts will be found in `*/build/libs`.

You can install the Maven artifacts to your local Maven repository:
+ using Bash or PowerShell: `./gradlew install`
+ using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew install`

You can restore the project to a pristine state:
+ using Bash or PowerShell: `./gradlew clean`
+ using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew clean`

<a name="conventions"></a>

## Conventions

Most package names begin with `jme3utilities`.  Packages copied from
jMonkeyEngine, however, retain their original names, which began with `com.jme3`.

The source code is compatible with JDK 7.
The pre-built libraries are compatible with JDK 8.
